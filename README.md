# icejson

A small JSON parser with minimum lines of code contained in only two files

Why another JSON parser?<br/>
There are lot of JSON parsers already which I could have used but I wanted to learn <b>"Recursive Descent Parsers"</b> so choose to implement one for JSON

Why the name Icejson?<br/>
Just wanted to have a fancy name. There is no real reason for choosing this name

Description about Icejson :<br/>
Even though the parser was created for learning pupropse it is full JSON compatible
