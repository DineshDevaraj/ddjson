# icejson

A small JSON parser with minimum lines of code contained in only two files

Why another JSON parser?
There are lot of JSON parsers already which I could have used but I wanted to learn "Recursive Descent Parsers" so choose to implement one for JSON

Why the name Icejson?
There is no real reason for choosing this name. Just wanted to have a fancy name

Description about Icejson : 
Even though the parser was created for learning pupropse It is full JSON compatible
