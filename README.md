# ddjson

A small JSON parser with minimum lines of code contained in just two files

<b>Why another JSON parser?</b><br/>
There are lot of JSON parsers already which I could have used but I wanted to learn <b>"Recursive Descent Parsers"</b> so choose to implement one for JSON

<b>Description about ddjson :</b><br/>
Even though the parser was created for learning pupropse it is full JSON compatible
