# icejson

A small JSON parser with minimum lines of code contained in just two files

<b>Why another JSON parser?</b><br/>
There are lot of JSON parsers already which I could have used but I wanted to learn <b>"Recursive Descent Parsers"</b> so choose to implement one for JSON

<b>Why the name Icejson?</b><br/>
Just wanted to have a fancy name. There is no real reason for choosing this name

<b>Description about Icejson :</b><br/>
Even though the parser was created for learning pupropse it is full JSON compatible
